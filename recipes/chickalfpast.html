    <li>8 oz fettucine pasta</li>
    <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

    <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><b>Steps</b></h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook Pasta: <br></strong>Boil fettuccine pasta in salted water until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Chicken: <br></strong> Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper. In a pan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through. Remove chicken from the pan and set aside.</li>
